I like to code cause its fun to see how your actions control a whole other world

I'm very creative and in the future i'll be working on games and blogs and other creative passions of mine.

This is just somewhere to keep my failed projects which ended badly and public projects which I don't believe i'll be updating very often as I like to keep most of my projects private.

I'll keep you updated on my private projects (very vaguely) from time to time. (If i don't forget that is)

Stay tuned.
